CDI

user creates a conversion, it is written to mongo
Upon creating a conversion, the user has to upload a file (this goes to the file access API, which does virus scans and publishes an event), we subscribe to that event, pull the file, and transform it to jsonl
Upon transformation we publish a message to a queue that has fannout enabled, we then kick off several lambdas that do validation, and parse out important information from the files that will be used later
